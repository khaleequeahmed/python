#TypeCasting is a way to convert one data type to another

a="3534"
a= int(a) #this will convert string to integer (if possible)
print(type(a)) 
print(a+5)
print(a*2)

# b="khaleeque"
# a= int(b) 
# '''now this is not possible to convert string to integer 
# because this is written in alphabets not in number we can only 
# convert string to integer when string is written in number only not in alphabets'''
# print(type(b))
